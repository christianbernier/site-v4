<h1 class="page-title">Hello!</h1>
<p>
	I'm a software engineer at <a href="https://cisco.com">Cisco Systems</a>, working on a web-based firewall orchestration platform. I recently graduated from <a href="https://northeastern.edu">Northeastern University</a> with a degree in computer science and physics.
</p>
<p>
	During my time at Northeastern, I worked as a particle physics research assistant at <a href="https://home.cern">CERN</a> in Geneva, Switzerland. I was also a teaching assistant for Northeastern's theory of computation course (CS 3800), object-oriented design (CS 3500), and algorithms and data structures (CS 3000).
